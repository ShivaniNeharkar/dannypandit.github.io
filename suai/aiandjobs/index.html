                examining efforts by Trump and his allies to block President Biden's 2020 election victory, including
                the events that led up to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. Trump announced last week that his
                lawyers had been informed by the Justice Department that he could face charges in that case as well. On
                Thursday, his lawyers met with prosecutors about the investigation, according to a message Trump posted
                on Truth Social.

            <p class="paragraph">To be, or not to be: that is the question: whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
                the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing
                end them? To die: to sleep; no more; and, by a sleep to say we end the heart-ache and the thousand
                natural shocks that flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; to
                sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub; for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we
                have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause. There's the respect that makes calamity of so
                long a life; for who would bear the whips and scorns of time, the oppressor's wrong, the proud man's
                contumely, the pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay, the insolence of office, and the spurns that
                patient merit of the unworthy takes, when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin?

                death,
                the undiscover'd country from whose bourn no traveller returns, puzzles the will, and makes us rather
                bear those ills we have, than fly to others that we know not of? Thus consience doth make cowards of us
                all; and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, and
                enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry, and lose the name of
                action.
