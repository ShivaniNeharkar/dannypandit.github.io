        <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be, or not to be: that is the question: whether 'tis nobler in the
            mind to suffer
            the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing
            end them? To die: to sleep; no more; and, by a sleep to say we end the heart-ache and the thousand
            natural shocks that flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; to
            sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub; for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we
            have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause. There's the respect that makes calamity of so
            long a life; for who would bear the whips and scorns of time, the oppressor's wrong, the proud man's
            contumely, the pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay, the insolence of office, and the spurns that
            patient merit of the unworthy, when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin?

            something after death, the undiscover'd country from whose bourn no traveller returns, puzzles the will, and
            makes us rather
            bear those ills we have, than fly to others that we know not of? Thus consience doth make cowards of us
            all; and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, and
            enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry, and lose the name of
            action.
