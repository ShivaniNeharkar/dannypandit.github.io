                <span class="hugeLetter">I</span>n this dataset, we conducted a survey on the Syracuse University campus and the surrounding Syracuse area regarding social media and online privacy. In recent years, there have been more issues and news surrounding privacy online and on social media. Companies are increasingly using users’ data to fuel their marketing tactics. Due to this, we asked our respondents if they have noticed privacy issues online or on social media. In addition, we asked if people have changed any of their behaviors because of privacy online and in social media. For this survey, we got 34 responses from a variety of people aged 17 to 74.
            </p>

<p class="paragraph">In every group identified in the survey—SU graduate students, SU undergraduate students, SU professors, SU staff, and others—the majority of respondents were “somewhat careful” when monitoring their activities online and on social media. In multiple groups, respondents were “very careful.” Very few people—only four of our 34 respondents—said they didn’t care at all about their online activity. This shows that among all groups, people are changing their online behaviors because they know companies are using their data for marketing purposes.</p>

               In order to see if people have changed their behaviors online or on social media due to privacy concerns, we asked how they monitor their behaviors. For the people who answered that they are changing their behavior, we allowed them to select different options. The highest number of people said they changed their behavior by making their profile private or putting content behind a paywall. Only one person chose to delete social media profiles because of privacy concerns and one person didn’t change their behaviors.

            Behavior monitoring on social media and online is common, as seen here by the chart indicated by the level of concern. When asked if they changed their behavior online, people also answered how concerned they are, with 1 being not at all concerned and 7 being most concerned. The maximum level of concern for people who did not change their behaviors, but will start to be 7, indicating that awareness causes a change in behavior.
