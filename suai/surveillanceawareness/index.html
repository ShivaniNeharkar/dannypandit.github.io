                <span class="hugeLetter">A</span>ccording to an <a href="https://dailyorange.com/2017/04/under-watch-with-1100-security-cameras-syracuse-university-is-one-of-the-most-watched-campuses-in-the-country/">investigation</a> 
                published by the Daily Orange in 2016, there were 1,100 security cameras across campus reporting back to eight 65-inch flat screen televisions at the Department of Public Safety (DPS) in Sims Hall. Now, over six years later, students and faculty are expressing concerns about surveillance on campus. 

            <br/>
             &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A study conducted by graduate students at the Newhouse School of Public Communications revealed that around 81% of the survey participants knew about Syracuse University’s use of surveillance camera’s.  However they didn’t know that NY state is one-party consent state when it comes to recording, as shown in Fig. 1 Knowledge of New York state recording law.</p>

             <p class="paragraph"> 
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While 95% of survey respondents shared that they feel safe on campus, only 57% of participants said that it is necessary to have over 1,000 security cameras on campus.  When asked about the intentions behind this survaillance footage and why SU would record the campus, 44% of students believe it's for safety efforts. On th other hand, 6% believe the footage will be used for student policing.  The majority believe that the surveillance will be used for both reasons, as shown in Fig. 2 Campus Surveillance Intentions. </p>
